# Learning to Manipulate under Limited Information

README.md for the code used in the paper "Learning to Manipulate under Limited Information" by Wesley H. Holliday, Alexander Kristoffersen, and Eric Pacuit.

## Notebooks

* Learning to Manipulate.ipynb: This is the main notebook containing all the code for training and evaluating MLPs (including code to create graphs).

* Learning to Manipulate - Example Manipulations.ipynb: In this notebook, you can select a trained MLP (for Borda) to manipulate using majority matrix information. 
    * model_functions.ipynb: The notebook containing all the code needed to find example manipulations. This notebook is imported into Learning to Manipulate - Example Manipulations.ipynb.

* Ideal Manipulators.ipynb: Code to generate the ideal manipulator graphs in Figures 1 and 2.

## Other Files/Directories

1. example_trained_models/Borda_1_6_10_uniform_('majority',)_1_08-18-2023_09-10-18.pickle:  Pickle file containing a dictionary of all the trained MLPs for Borda, generation 1, 6 candidates, 10 voters using majority matrix information. 

2. evaluation/*: Subfolders that contain the evaluation data to produce the graphs in the paper and the supplementary material. 

3. ideal_manipulator_data/*: Subfolders that contain the evaluation data for the ideal manipulators.

4. graphs/*: Subfolders that contain the graphs generated by the visualization code.

5. graphs_in_papers/*: Subfolders that contain the graphs used in the paper and the supplementary material.

6. supplementary_material_graphs/*: Subfolders that contain the graphs for the supplementary material.

**Note**: Running the main notebook will generate additional subdirectories.

## Requirements

The following packages are required to run the notebooks:

- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [pref_voting: Preferential Voting Tools](https://pref-voting.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/storage/latest)
- The notebooks and the pref_voting library is built around a full SciPy stack: [MatPlotLib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [numba](http://numba.pydata.org/), 
- [tqdm.notebook](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)  
- [multiprocess](https://pypi.org/project/multiprocess/)
